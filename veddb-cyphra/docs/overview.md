# VedDB Rust Client Overview

Welcome to the VedDB Rust client documentation. This document provides a high-level view of the project structure, design goals, and the relationship between the library, CLI, and the core VedDB server.

## ✨ Project Goals

- **High-performance client** with async/await support built on Tokio.
- **Unified experience** across library and CLI tooling.
- **Simple integration** for Rust developers building services on top of VedDB.
- **Platform focus** on Windows (current production target) with planned cross-platform support.

## 🧱 Architectural Components

- **`Client`**: High-level asynchronous client that manages connections and provides the VedDB API (set, get, delete, list, ping).
- **`Connection`**: Low-level TCP protocol implementation handling framing, retries, and error translation.
- **`ConnectionPool`**: Configurable connection pooling for parallel workloads.
- **`Error`**: Rich error type capturing protocol, I/O, and server errors.
- **`veddb-cli`**: CLI tool built on the same library code, demonstrating idiomatic usage patterns.

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. Applications construct a `Client` using `Client::connect` or `Client::with_pool_size`.
2. The `Client` delegates to `Connection` instances that implement the VedDB binary protocol.
3. Responses are parsed into strongly typed `Response` objects with helpful status codes.
4. Errors are propagated via the unified `Error` enum to the caller.
5. The CLI reuses the library capabilities to provide a human friendly interface.
